# ElmMusic
A Synthesizer implemented in Elm using Tone.js.

To play, clone the directory and install npm:

`npm install`

Then make using the command:

`elm make src/ElmAndTone.elm --output elm-comp.js`

Then run a server in the same directory as index.html. I like to use http-server.
Install using npm:

`npm install http-server`

Start the server: 

`http-server` 

and visit the site provided.

You may also need to install the following:

`npm install tone`

`elm install carwow/elm-slider`

`elm install rundis/elm-bootstrap`
