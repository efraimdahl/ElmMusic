# ElmMusic
A Synthesizer implemented in Elm using Tone.js.

To play, clone the file and install the dependencies by running

npm install in the directory

elm make src/ElmAndTone.elm --output elm-comp.js

Then run a server in the same directory as index.html

I like to use http-server
Install using npm -> npm install http-server
Then run by typing: http-server in a commandline, then visit the site.
